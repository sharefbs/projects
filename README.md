## Password Generator

Going to make a password generator that initially works by making passwords given a criteria.
Then, I'll make the password generator save the password onto the user's host computer.
Then, I will explore creating UI/UX by making a GUI for the password generator.
The final product should be a easy to plug and play password generator-manager mix.
(Tentative) Perhaps, I will explore API and cloud interfacing along with encryption technology.
